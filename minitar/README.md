# minitar

## Functionality

Remake in Rust of the CSCI4061: Intro to Operating Systems minitar project that was originally in C. Source code to that project will not be included due to academic dishonesty concerns.

This program serves to replicate the functionality of the `tar` archiving utility. It utilizes file I/O and robust error handling in order to properly archive and extract files.
