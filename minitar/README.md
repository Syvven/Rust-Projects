# minitar

## Functionality

Remake in Rust of the CSCI4061: Intro to Operating Systems minitar project that was originally in C. Source code to that project will not be included due to academic dishonesty concerns.

This program serves to replicate the functionality of the `tar` archiving utility. It utilizes file I/O and robust error handling in order to properly archive and extract files. Included are a couple files in the `test_files` directory to test the functionality on. 

## Usage

- First, make sure you have rust and cargo installed.
- Clone the repository and cd into the `minitar` directory.
- Create any files you would like to contain in the Archive, or use the test files in the `test_files` subdirectory.
